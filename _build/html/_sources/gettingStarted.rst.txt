==============================
Getting Started with Atra
==============================

Welcome to the Atra Platform. In this section we will cover how to setup your environment to be able to interact with the Atra Platform.

--------------------------
Prerequisites
--------------------------
.. note:: Mobile browsers are not supported

The Atra Platform requires users to be on one of the following desktop browsers that `MetaMask`_ supports

.. _`MetaMask` : https://metamask.io/

* Chrome Desktop
* Firefox Desktop
* Opera Desktop
* Brave Desktop

--------------------------
Creating a Metamask Wallet
--------------------------
The first thing any user needs is an Ethereum Wallet. A wallet allows you to interact with the ethereum blockchain and the Atra Platform. 

MetaMask is a free ethereum wallet built into a browser extension that allows you to manage your wallets independently from any website. From the MetaMask extension users are able send digital currency (Ether) and approve transactions initiated from websites. Your metamask wallet can be used on any website that's ethereum enabled, that includes the Atra Console. The Atra Console is the user interface to our platform of services. Lets setup Metamask.

1. Open the `MetaMask site`_ in a new tab and select a supported browser and install the extension.
2. Follow the onscreen steps to Create an Account.
3. Backup your Seed Words and you're all done.

.. _`MetaMask site` : https://metamask.io/

--------------------------------
Using the Ethereum Test Network
--------------------------------

After you've successfully installed MetaMask in your browser you'll need some ethereum currency (Ether) in your wallet. Instead of spending real money lets switch MetaMask to use an ethereum test network. Test networks are community supported and used for the purpose of testing new contracts and allowing users to interact with DApps without spending real money.

.. note :: The Atra Platform is currently in Beta and the only supported network is the Rinkeby Test Net.

Open Metamask by clicking on the extension and click the dropdown in the upper left corner of the dialog and select the Rinkeby Test Net.

----------------------------
Funding Your Metamask Wallet
----------------------------

Now that you've installed MetaMask, created a wallet, switched the network to Rinkeby Test Net, we are now ready to fund your wallet with Ether. 

.. note:: Ether assigned to a test net wallet does not carry over to the Main Network or any other test net.

Lets go get some Ether for our wallet by using the Rinkeby Faucet, open the faucet site in a new tab (https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) and follow directions for funding your account.

A faucet is an application that gives out ether to wallet addresses that want to use it on a test net. This specific faucet requires some social media verification of your address, as to not flood the test net with transactions.

It takes less than a minute and you'll have the Ether balance reflected in your Metamask wallet after the faucet's onscreen progress has completed.

Congrats, that was your first Ethereum Transaction.

Now that you've received Ether in your wallet you're ready interact with the Atra Platform. Select a service from the sidebar list and follow it's walkthrough.
